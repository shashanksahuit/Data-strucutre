in any data strucure there will be 3 operations
store or add [insert]
search 
delete

you have to play with these 3 operation in any data structure 
Always try to compare the Data-structure based on these operation 
******************************************************************************


BST --> o (log N) in Binary search Tree 
access or Search operation in constant time o(1);

HashMaps
in hashmap we store the key and value 
key , value 

-------------grep command use the HashMap --> [google it and read about it]

HashCode --> with some formula you will calaclulate this hashcode 

key should be the  posistive Integer 
Hashcode can be very large so we have to reduce it


collision 
we have 2 ways to aviod the Collision 
      1. chaining 
      2. open addressing

worst case in chaining --> inside linkedList , you have to iterate over the all linkedlist and in that case time complexity O(N).
